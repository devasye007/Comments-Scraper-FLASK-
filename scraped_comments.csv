Review
"Good design, strong built, no leakage, appropriate weight when empty bottle but once filled it may feel big and heavy for some people but for me it's OK coz I'm using it for home, the cap flip cover clicks twice while closing which locks it good and does not open. All in all it's too big to carry daily however for home or office use it's perfect. Anyone who wants to buy, go for it.Read more"
"Nice bottle. Easy to clean, sleek looking but found minor plastic fibers popping out of the mouth. Ignored it and shaved them. The carry rope/ thread tore and the bottle fell from the height full of water. Although the bottle didnâ€™t break but the thread/ carrying it is no moreRead more"
It's totally worth the price. The quality of the plastic material is really nice and it's light weight too.Read more
"Totally worth the money! The bottle plastic is very sturdy and thick, seems very durable and a long term product! Also, the hinges seem strong and the cloth strip to hold and carry the bottle is strongly attached to handle 2kgs weight easily.The markings and comments don't seem chapri like other bottles ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„The surface might have to be protected from scratches though, which is understandable. the bottle mouth is big enough to unscrew and clean rigourously with a bottle cleaner brush.Read more"
"I absolutely love this bottle! The 2-liter capacity is ideal for keeping me hydrated throughout the day without needing constant refills. The motivational time markers are a great touch â€” they genuinely encourage me to drink water consistently. The design is sturdy and stylish, and the handle makes it super easy to carry around. Itâ€™s perfect for home, work, or even the gym. Highly recommend for anyone looking to boost their daily water intake!Read more"
